Code presented in the run_analysis.R is divided into secions from 1 to 5, according to questions.
I have used R-Studio, Set my session to the dataset directory.
Read the table using read.table(). I have used X_train and X_test to combine to X_data, similarly for y and subdata.
Combine the diiferent table by using rcind() and cbind().

##Identifiers
subject - The ID of the test subject
activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
